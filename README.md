## Findings
-The most successful parent category kcikstarters in the US were tehatre productions, of those, plays were the most successful subcategory.

-Successful US plays kickstarters often have goal and pledged amounts about equal.

-Successful US plays also have a duration that is about 1 week shorter than that of failed play kickerstarters.

-The most successful US play kickstarters occured in May and June.

## Reccommendations
I recommend Louise kickstart a US play in late spring or early summer, with pledged dollars as close to ehr fundraising goal as possible. 

### Challenge
Analyzes chances of plays success based on fundraising goal amount and chances of theatre kickstarter success based on launch date.
