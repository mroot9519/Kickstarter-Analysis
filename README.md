![Parent Categories Outcomes](https://github.com/mroot9519/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/master/Chart%201.png)
## Findings
-The most successful parent category kcikstarters in the US were tehatre productions, of those, plays were the most successful subcategory.

-Successful US plays kickstarters often have goal and pledged amounts about equal.

-Successful US plays also have a duration that is about 1 week shorter than that of failed play kickerstarters.

-The most successful US play kickstarters occured in May and June.

## Reccommendations
I recommend Louise kickstart a US play in late spring or early summer, with pledged dollars as close to ehr fundraising goal as possible. 

### Challenge
Analyzes chances of plays success based on fundraising goal amount and chances of theatre kickstarter success based on launch date.

### Challenge findings
- Successful kickstarters tend to have more modest fundraising goals (less than 10000.
- Most successful theatre kickstarters occur in late spring through early sumemr (April through July.)
- Within the theatre parent caetegory, 0 play productions had been canceled.

### Data Set Limitations
The above conclusions were did not have any filtering based on location, therefore there is potential oversight of geographic nuances. The fundraising goal portion was based off of the goals column in the data set, but these amounts are not all USD, therefore there is no adjustment for foreign exchange.
